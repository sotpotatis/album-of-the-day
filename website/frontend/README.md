# Frontend website

This directory contains the frontend UI that fetches data from the backend. The frontend shows the following:

It also includes a search function.

## Installing

`npm install` will do the trick!

For generating favicons, you can also install [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)'s CLI: `npm install -g real-favicon`

## Developing

`npm run dev` will start a development server.

## Building

- Run `npm run favicon` to update favicons if you have changed them.
- Then run, `npm run build`.
